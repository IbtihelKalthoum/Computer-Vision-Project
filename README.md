 END-TO-END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
## 1. Feature Engineering
As a first step, we perform Feature Engineering by extracting Histogram of Oriented 
Gradients (HOG) features using the Scikit-Image library.
## 2. Binary Classification using Scikit-Learn
We first split the data into training and test sets
Then, we build different binary classifiers with the best estimator for each one
## 3. Evaluating the Best Face Detector
## 4. Finding Faces in a New Image
We run a sliding window over a new image and evaluate each patch
